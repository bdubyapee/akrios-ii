    "description": "Ogres are the brutes of the evil races. Large, strong, and stubborn they\ndon't hesitate to use force, in fact it is the first thing they do in any\nsituation. They are often used as bodyguards and physcial labor, and not\nalways by their choice, by powerful magical races like the Mazreki. The ogre\nsociety is based on strength, of course, the strongest leads and must defend\nis place in the hierarchy on a regular basis. Ogres dwell in tribes on the\nwestern plains of Akrios, although they do have a city of sorts located in\nthe southern plains where the strongest and smartest chieftains rules. Ogres\nstand 7'5\" to 9'0\". Their eyes are brown, blue, or green. Their hair is\nwhite, black, or brown. Their skin color ranges from pale to dark brown.\nMost evil races are weary when traveling with them, but prefer to take their\nchances with them rather than against them.",
