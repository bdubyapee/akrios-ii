    "description": "This island rests quietly in the middle of a pond of pure clear water. Along\n\rthe banks of the island round, red stained, wooden posts stand side by side\n\rsurrounding the small island. Short cut grass covers the ground and a few\n\rstone benches sit near the edges of the pond for people to sit on and gaze\n\rout onto the water. A red wooden bridge connects the island to the east bank\n\rof the tiny lake.",
