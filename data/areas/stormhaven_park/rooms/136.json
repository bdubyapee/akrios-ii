    "description": "Below this bridge crystal clear water rests calmly, with only the occasional\n\rripple disturbing the surface of the pond. The bridge itself is made of\n\rfinely sanded wood stained a dark red, and is wide enough to let a few\n\rpeople stand side by side. Handrails made of the same red stained wood run\n\ron either side of the bridge, offering support and safety for those\n\rcrossing. To the west is a small island upon which several stone benches\n\rsit. To the east a dirt path leads off into the trees.",
