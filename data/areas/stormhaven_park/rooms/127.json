    "description": "This small shed holds a variety of tools that the groundskeepers use to\n\rmaintain the pond and the clearing it sits in. The shed itself seems to be\n\rin fair condition with no missing boards or planks. Everything appears to be\n\rorderly and clean. There are no windows, but there are several benches and\n\rracks upon which numerous tools rest. A door on the east wall leads back out\n\rto the clearing and pond.",
