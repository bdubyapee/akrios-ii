    "description": "The tiny, overgrown trail suddenly empties out into a clearing that stands\n\rbefore a cave. Tall grass and bushes surround a semicircle of solid rock on\n\rthe ground. The cave appears to be nothing more than a large rock sitting\n\ratop another with a gap between the two. Enormous trees loom over the\n\rclearing and cave as if trying to hide it from the outside world.",
