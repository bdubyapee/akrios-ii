    "description": "Large trees stand tall along either side of a path of hard packed dirt,\n\rtheir branches reaching out over the path creating a living roof over the\n\rtrail. Tall grass and a variety of bushes fill in the spaces between the\n\rtrees creating a wall of vegetation on either side of the walkway. The wide\n\rdirt path makes a slight turn leading off to the west and northeast through\n\rthe park.",
