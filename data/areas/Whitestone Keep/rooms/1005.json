    "description": " Polished smooth cobblestone lines the road leading both north and south. To\n\rthe east the smooth white granite wall that surrounds the city reaches high\n\rinto the sky. Criss crossed with sparkling mineral veins, the wall stands at\n\rleast twenty feet tall. To the west is a large stone building, sounds of\n\rmerriment floating out of the windows. Above the door to the building is a\n\rsign, \"William the Braves Tavern\". East Wall Road continues on to the north\n\rand south.",
