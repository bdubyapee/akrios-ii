Although demon\n\rblood runs in their veins they do not possess the great strength true demons\n\rdo, only their magical abilities are close to matching their demon kind that\n\rand their appearance are the only similiarities between the two. Noone is\n\rquite sure how this race came into exsistance, it is rumored however that\n\rthey were some failed experiment performed by a god who is less than sane.\n\rThe Mazreki reside within the mountian range known as the Twilight Peaks. A\n\rdreadful place of death and darkness the Twilight Peaks are a wall of\n\rmountains that are made up of jagged and sharp black rock. Only a handful of\n\rthe deadliest and hardiest of plants and animals can survive within the\n\rconfines of the Twilight Peaks, the Mazreki being the deadliest and fiercest\n\rof all. The Mazreki, although quite evil, have a strict hierarchy and lawful\n\rsociety. Their hierarchy is determined by age, because the older a Mazreki\n\rgets the more powerful and stronger it becomes. Mareki live for long periods\n\rof time and usually die of treachery rather than of old age. Age can be\n\rdetermined by the length of their horns that extend from their foreheads.\n\rThe longer the horns the older the Mazreki is. Besides the horns Mazreki\n\rhave leathery bat-like wings, long whip-like tails and razor sharp talons.\n\rAlthough they have wings, they are not strong enough to fly. They can break\n\rlong falls and leap great heights with the aid of their wings, some can even\n\rfly for short distances but for the most part Mazreki are fairly weak\n\rphysically. They are a slim race that stand from 5'5\" to about 6'0\". A fine\n\rblack, brown, or grey fur covers their bodies. They have red, pink, or\n\rviolet eyes. Athough weak physically they have an unnatural constitution\n\rthat gives them amazing resistance to disease and they regenerate almost as\n\rfast as a troll. This regeneration and ability for magic makes them quite\n\rdangerous to encounter. When apart of a multirace adventuring group they\n\rusually lead for the other evil races fear them, except the drow. Drow and\n\rMazreki have a healty respect for each other and get along with each other\n\rwell, or as well as evil races do.",
