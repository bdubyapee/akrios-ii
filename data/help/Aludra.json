Her worshippers specialties are\n\rresurrection and healing spells, with a variety of protection spells.\n\rAludra's followers are your run of the mill cleric types. She does not\n\rdetest death as she realizes this is a necessity for life, but she would\n\rprefer to see a life saved rather than lost. She is rather good natured and\n\rslow to anger, she does however detest Sirian. She also thinks Admanthos an\n\rabomination of life because of his mystical and thus unnatural existance.\n\rShe is known to get along well with Selucia.",
